# Poetic Journal
https://hasinae.github.io/poetic-journal/


Poetic Journal is a creative web-based tool that allows users to write journal entries with a unique twist: it automatically adds poetry between the lines of your entries. This project is built using Phaser and JavaScript, creating a dynamic and visually engaging experience for users.
(This is an ongoing development)

## Idea Behind the Project
The goal of this project is to blend journaling with creative writing. By introducing randomly generated poetic lines between user entries, the journal becomes more than just a recording tool â€” it evolves into an artistic and reflective space, encouraging inspiration and introspection.

## Features
- **Journal Entries**: Users can write and save their personal thoughts.
- **Dynamic Poetry**: Automatically inserts poetic lines between journal entries to enhance creativity.
- **Typewriter Style**: Text appears in a typewriter-inspired font for an authentic feel.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built using Phaser for a smooth and engaging experience.

## Tools and Technologies
